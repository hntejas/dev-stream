### Reflection

Working on this project helped me understand designing reusable components. Here I tried to build my own UI components such as loaders and Modals. 

I have used techniques like client lying for updating the like to give user least latency for simple actions.

I have utilized libraries like React Router v6, axios, react toastify in this project.
